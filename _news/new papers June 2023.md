Very pleased to have started to get a backlog of papers finally out:
- [Maxwell's Demon walks into Wall Street: Stochastic Thermodynamics meets Expected Utility Theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00449) with Andres Ducuara, Francesco Buscemi, Peter Sidajaya and Valerio Scarani
- [Fundamental connections between utility theories of wealth and information theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07975) with Andres Ducuara
- [The Dynamical Resource Theory of Informational Non-Equilibrium](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16848) with Ben Stratton and Chung-Yun Hsieh. This is Ben's first paper, and Chung-Yun's first Bristol paper, to congratulations to them both!
