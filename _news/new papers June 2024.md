Very pleased to once again getting a backlog of papers out this year: 
- [Locally inaccessible hidden quantum correlations](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2406.03945) with Andres Ducuara and Cristian Susa. This is one of a few results Andres obtained during his PhD that we are finally getting round to publishing. 
- [Operational Interpretation of the Choi Rank Through k-State Exclusion](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2406.08360) with Ben Stratton and Chung-Yun Hsieh. Ben's 2nd paper during his PhD, which I think is a very nice result about quantum channels. 
- [Activation of post-quantum steering](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2406.10570) with Ana Belen Sainz and Matty Hoban. This is a ridiculously overdue paper, which I'm delighted to finally have out. 
- [Activation of post-quantumness in bipartite generalised EPR scenarios](https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2406.10697) with Beata Zjawin, Matty Hoban and Ana Belen Sainz. A generalisation of the above paper, which we put out at the same time. Beata did all of the hard work here!
- [Revising the quantum work fluctuation framework to encompass energy conservation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18632v1) with Giulia Rubino and Karen Hovhannisyan. My first paper with Giulia! 
There will be a few more to come this summer, so I'll post an update later.
