title={Operational Interpretation of the Choi Rank Through k-State Exclusion}, 
abstract={The Choi-state is an indispensable tool in the study and analysis of quantum channels. Considering a channel in terms of its associated Choi-state can greatly simplify problems. It also offers an alternative approach to the characterisation of a channel, with properties of the Choi-state providing novel insight into a channel's behaviour. The rank of a Choi-state, termed the Choi-rank, has proven to be an important characterising property, and here, its significance is further elucidated through an operational interpretation. The Choi-rank is shown to provide a universal bound on how successfully two agents, Alice and Bob, can perform an entanglement-assisted exclusion task. The task can be considered an extension of super-dense coding, where Bob can only output information about Alice's encoded bit-string with certainty. Conclusive state exclusion, in place of state discrimination, is therefore considered at the culmination of the super-dense coding protocol. In order to prove this result, a necessary condition for conclusive k-state exclusion of a set of states is presented in order to achieve this result, and the notions of weak and strong exclusion are introduced.},

title={Activation of post-quantumness in bipartite generalised EPR scenarios}, 
abstract={Correlations generated in generalised Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) scenarios are examples of non-signalling bipartite resources that can exhibit post-quantum behavior. There exist assemblages that, despite being post-quantum resources, can only generate quantum correlations in bipartite Bell-type scenarios. Here, we present a protocol for activation of post-quantumness in bipartite Bob-with-input, measurement-device-independent and channel EPR scenarios. By designing a protocol that involves distributing the assemblages in a larger network, we derive tailored Bell inequalities which can be violated beyond their quantum bound in this new set-up.},

title={The Hadamard gate cannot be replaced by a resource state in universal quantum computation}, 
abstract={We consider models of quantum computation that involve operations performed on some fixed resourceful quantum state. Examples that fit this paradigm include magic state injection and measurement-based approaches. We introduce a framework that incorporates both of these cases and focus on the role of coherence (or superposition) in this context, as exemplified through the Hadamard gate. We prove that given access to incoherent unitaries (those that are unable to generate superposition from computational basis states, e.g. CNOT, diagonal gates), classical control, computational basis measurements, and any resourceful ancillary state (of arbitrary dimension), it is not possible to implement any coherent unitary (e.g. Hadamard) exactly with non-zero probability. We also consider the approximate case by providing lower bounds for the induced trace distance between the above operations and n Hadamard gates. To demonstrate the stability of this result, this is then extended to a similar no-go result for the case of using k Hadamard gates to exactly implement n>k Hadamard gates.},

title={Locally inaccessible hidden quantum correlations}, 
abstract={We prove, modulo a conjecture on quantum steering ellipsoids being true, the existence of the phenomenon of locally inaccessible hidden quantum correlations. That is, the existence of two-particle states whose hidden quantum correlations cannot be revealed by local filters implemented exclusively on one side of the experiment, but that can still be revealed when both parties cooperate in applying judiciously chosen local filters. The quantum correlations here considered are the violation of the CHSH-inequality for Bell-nonlocality and the violation of the F3-inequality for EPR-steering. Specifically, we provide a necessary criterion for guaranteeing the presence of such phenomenon for arbitrary two-qubit states. This criterion in turn relies on the conjecture that the maximal violation of CHSH-inequality and F3-inequality are both upper bounded by functions that depend on the magnitude of the quantum steering ellipsoid centre. This latter conjecture, although currently lacking an analytical proof, is supported by numerical results. We use this necessary criterion to explicitly show examples of two-qubit states with locally inaccessible hidden quantum correlations and, furthermore, two-qubit states with locally inaccessible maximal hidden quantum correlations.},

title={Speeding up quantum measurement using space-time trade-off}, 
abstract={We present a scheme for speeding up quantum measurement. The scheme builds on previous protocols that entangle the system to be measured with ancillary systems. In the idealised situation of perfect entangling operations and no decoherence, it gives an exact space-time trade-off meaning the readout speed increases linearly with the number of ancilla. We verify this scheme is robust against experimental imperfections through numerical modelling of gate noise and readout errors, and under certain circumstances our scheme can even lead to better than linear improvement in the speed of measurement with the number of systems measured. This hardware-agnostic approach is broadly applicable to a range of quantum technology platforms and offers a route to accelerate mid-circuit measurement as required for effective quantum error correction.},

title={Revising the quantum work fluctuation framework to encompass energy conservation}, 
abstract={Work is a process-based quantity, and its measurement typically requires interaction with a measuring device multiple times. While classical systems allow for non-invasive and accurate measurements, quantum systems present unique challenges due to the influence of the measuring device on the final value of work. As recent studies have shown, among these challenges is the impossibility of formulating a universal definition of work that respects energy conservation for coherent quantum systems and is compatible with the Jarzynski equality - a fluctuation relation linking the equilibrium free energy difference to the non-equilibrium work. Here we overcome this challenge by introducing a genuinely quantum, positive correction to the Jarzynski equality stemming from imposing energy conservation. When sufficiently large, this correction forces quantum work to violate the second law more often. Moreover, we construct modified two-point measurement (TPM) schemes for work that ensure energy conservation for coherent quantum states and align with our quantum-corrected fluctuation relation. We further underscore the practicality and effectiveness of these schemes by providing detailed circuit implementations for them.},

title={Activation of post-quantum steering}, 
abstract={There are possible physical theories that give greater violations of Bell's inequalities than the corresponding Tsirelson bound, termed post-quantum non-locality. Such theories do not violate special relativity, but could give an advantage in certain information processing tasks. There is another way in which entangled quantum states exhibit non-classical phenomena, with one notable example being Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) steering; a violation of a bipartite Bell inequality implies EPR steering, but the converse is not necessarily true. The study of post-quantum EPR steering is more intricate, but it has been shown that it does not always imply post-quantum non-locality in a conventional Bell test. In this work we show how to distribute resources in a larger network that individually do not demonstrate post-quantum non-locality but violate a Tsirelson bound for the network. That is, we show how to activate post-quantum steering so that it can now be witnessed as post-quantum correlations in a Bell scenario. One element of our work that may be of independent interest is we show how to self-test a bipartite quantum assemblage in a network, even assuming post-quantum resources.},

title={The Dynamical Resource Theory of Informational Non-Equilibrium Preservability}, 
abstract={Information is instrumental in our understanding of thermodynamics. Their interplay has been studied through completely degenerate Hamiltonians whereby the informational contributions to thermodynamic transformations can be isolated. In this setting, all states other then the maximally mixed state are considered to be in informational non-equilibrium. An important yet still open question is: how to characterise the ability of quantum dynamics to maintain informational non-equilibrium? Here, the dynamical resource theory of informational non-equilibrium preservability is introduced to begin providing an answer to this question. A characterisation of the allowed operations is given for qubit channels and the n dimensional Weyl-covariant channels - a physically relevant subset of the general channels. An operational interpretation of a state discrimination game with Bell state measurements is given. Finally, an explicit link between a channels classical capacity and its ability to maintain informational non-equilibrium is made.},

abstract={abstract={The interplay between thermodynamics and information theory has a long history, but its quantitative manifestations are still being explored. We import tools from expected utility theory from economics into stochastic thermodynamics. We prove that, in a process obeying Crooks' fluctuation relations, every alpha Rényi divergence between the forward process and its reverse has the operational meaning of the ``certainty equivalent'' of dissipated work (or, more generally, of entropy production) for a player with risk aversion r=alpha−1. The two known cases alpha=1 and alpha=infinity are recovered and receive the new interpretation of being associated to a risk-neutral and an extreme risk-averse player respectively. Among the new results, the condition for alpha=0 describes the behavior of a risk-seeking player willing to bet on the transient violations of the second law. Our approach further leads to a generalized Jarzynski equality, and generalizes to a broader class of statistical divergences.},},

title={Quantum complementarity: A novel resource for unambiguous exclusion and encryption}, 
abstract={Complementarity is a phenomenon explaining several core features of quantum theory, such as the well-known uncertainty principle. Roughly speaking, two objects are said to be complementary if being certain about one of them necessarily forbids useful knowledge about the other. Two quantum measurements that do not commute form an example of complementary measurements, and this phenomenon can also be defined for ensembles of states. Although a key quantum feature, it is unclear whether complementarity can be understood more operationally, as a necessary resource in some quantum information task. Here we show this is the case, and relates to a novel task which we term η-unambiguous exclusion. As well as giving complementarity a clear operational definition, this also uncovers the foundational underpinning of unambiguous exclusion tasks for the first time. We further show that a special type of measurement complementarity is equivalent to advantages in certain encryption tasks. Finally, our analysis suggest that complementarity of measurement and state ensemble can be interpreted as strong forms of measurement incompatibility and quantum steering, respectively.},

abstract={We establish fundamental connections between utility theories of wealth from the economic sciences and information-theoretic quantities. In particular, we introduce operational tasks based on betting where both gambler and bookmaker have access to side information, or betting tasks with double side information for short. In order to characterise these operational tasks we introduce new conditional Rényi divergences, and explore some of their properties. Furthermore, we introduce an utility theory of wealth ratios, and operationally interpret there the two-parameter (q,r) generalised mutual information measure recently introduced by V. M. Ilić and I. V. Djordjević; it quantifies the advantage provided by side information in betting tasks for utility theories of wealth ratios. Moreover, we show that the Ilić-Djordjević conditional entropy satisfies a type of generalised chain rule, which generalises that of Arimoto-Rényi. Finally, we address the implications of these results on the quantum resource theories of informative measurements and non-constant channels. Altogether, these results further help strengthening the bridge between the theory of expected utility from the economic sciences and Shannon's theory of information.},

	title = {All quantum measurements are asymptotically equivalent},
	abstract = {We consider the problem of reproducing one quantum measurement given the ability to perform another. In particular, given the availability of a -- possibly imperfect -- quantum measurement which can be performed multiple times, we study to what extent it can reproduce the measurement statistics and post-measurement state of a second target measurement, in the most general setting where both the available and target measurements are arbitrary generalised quantum measurements. We show that this general problem in fact reduces to the ability to reproduce the statistics of von Neumann measurements, and that in the asymptotic limit of infinitely many uses of the available measurement, a simple protocol based upon `classical cloning' is able to perfectly achieve this task. This shows that asymptotically all (non-trivial) quantum measurements are equivalent. We also study optimal protocols for a fixed number of uses of the available measurement, and show that better protocols than classical cloning can be found in general. Our protocols show that the average error in reproducing a target measurement drops off exponentially fast, and that one can, for example, rapidly improve imperfect measurements by performing them a small number of times. This includes, but is not limited to, improving both noisy and lossy quantum measurements. Finally, we show that in a setting where we perform multiple measurements in parallel, we can moreover achieve finite-rate measurement reproduction, by using block-coding techniques from classical information theory.},

  title = {Characterisation of quantum betting tasks in terms of Arimoto mutual information},
  abstract = {We introduce operational quantum tasks based on betting with risk-aversion - or quantum betting tasks for short - inspired by standard quantum state discrimination and classical horse betting with risk-aversion and side information. In particular, we introduce the operational tasks of quantum state betting (QSB), noisy quantum state betting (nQSB), and quantum channel betting (QCB) played by gamblers with different risk tendencies. We prove that the advantage that informative measurements (non-constant channels) provide in QSB (nQSB) is exactly characterised by Arimoto's α-mutual information, with the order α determining the risk aversion of the gambler. More generally, we show that Arimoto-type information-theoretic quantities characterise the advantage that resourceful objects offer at playing quantum betting tasks when compared to resourceless objects, for general quantum resource theories (QRTs) of measurements, channels, states, and state-measurement pairs, with arbitrary resources. In limiting cases, we show that QSB (QCB) recovers the known tasks of quantum state (channel) discrimination when α → ∞, and quantum state (channel) exclusion when α → -∞. Inspired by these connections, we also introduce new quantum Rényi divergences for measurements, and derive a new family of resource monotones for the QRT of measurement informativeness. This family of resource monotones recovers in the same limiting cases as above, the generalised robustness and the weight of informativeness. Altogether, these results establish a broad and continuous family of four-way correspondences between operational tasks, mutual information measures, quantum Rényi divergences, and resource monotones, that can be seen to generalise two limiting correspondences that were recently discovered for the QRT of measurement informativeness.},

It is particularly interesting to consider scenarios where sources within the network are statistically independent, which leads to so-called network nonlocality, even when parties perform fixed measurements. Here we promote certain parties to be trusted and introduce the notion of network steering and network local hidden state (NLHS) models within this paradigm of independent sources. In one direction, we show how the results from Bell nonlocality and quantum steering can be used to demonstrate network steering. We further show that it is a genuinely novel effect by exhibiting unsteerable states that nevertheless demonstrate network steering based upon entanglement swapping yielding a form of activation. On the other hand, we provide no-go results for network steering in a large class of scenarios by explicitly constructing NLHS models.},

It demonstrates that in certain situations the very presence of entanglement can improve one's abilities of manipulating other entangled states. At the same time, however, it is not clear if using entanglement catalytically can provide additional power for any of the existing quantum protocols. Here we show, for the first time, that catalysis of entanglement can provide a genuine advantage in the task of quantum teleportation. More specifically, we show that extending the standard teleportation protocol by giving Alice and Bob the ability to use entanglement catalytically, allows them to achieve fidelity of teleportation at least as large as the regularisation of the standard teleportation quantifier, the so-called average fidelity of teleportation. Consequently, we show that this regularised quantifier surpasses the standard benchmark for a variety of quantum states, therefore demonstrating that there are quantum states whose ability to teleport can be further improved when assisted with entanglement in a catalytic way. This hints that entanglement catalysis can be a promising new avenue for exploring novel advantages in the quantum domain.},

  title = {Operational Significance of the Quantum Resource Theory of Buscemi Nonlocality},
  abstract = {Although entanglement is necessary for observing nonlocality in a Bell experiment, there are entangled states that can never be used to demonstrate nonlocal correlations. In a seminal paper Buscemi [Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{108}, 200401 (2012)] extended the standard Bell experiment by allowing Alice and Bob to be asked quantum, instead of classical, questions. This gives rise to a broader notion of nonlocality, one which can be observed for every entangled state. In this work we study a resource theory of this type of nonlocality referred to as Buscemi nonlocality. We propose a geometric quantifier measuring the ability of a given state and local measurements to produce Buscemi nonlocal correlations and prove the following results. First, we show that any distributed measurement that can demonstrate Buscemi nonlocal correlations provides strictly better performance than any distributed measurement that does not use entanglement in the task of distributed state discrimination, and that this advantage is quantified by the geometric quantifier we propose, thus establishing its operational significance. Second, we prove a quantitative relationship between Buscemi nonlocality, the ability to perform nonclassical teleportation, and entanglement. In particular, we show that the maximal amount of Buscemi nonlocality that can be generated using a given state is precisely equal to its entanglement content. Using this relationship, we propose new discrimination tasks for which nonclassical teleportation and entanglement lead to an advantage over their classical counterparts. Third, we interpret Buscemi nonlocality from the perspective of information theory and show that it is related to a single-shot capacity of a quantum-to-classical bipartite channel.},

  title = {All States are Universal Catalysts in Quantum Thermodynamics},
  abstract = {Quantum catalysis is a fascinating concept that demonstrates how certain transformations can only become possible when given access to a specific resource that has to be returned unaffected. It was first discovered in the context of entanglement theory, and since then, it has been applied in a number of resource-theoretic frameworks, including quantum thermodynamics. Although, in that case, the necessary (and sometimes also sufficient) conditions on the existence of a catalyst are known, almost nothing is known about the precise form of the catalyst state required by the transformation. In particular, it is not clear whether it has to have some special properties or be finely tuned to the desired transformation. In this work, we describe a surprising property of multicopy states: We show that in resource theories governed by majorization, all resourceful states are catalysts for all allowed transformations. In quantum thermodynamics, this means that the so-called “second laws of thermodynamics” do not require a fine-tuned catalyst; rather, any state, given sufficiently many copies, can serve as a useful catalyst. These analytic results are accompanied by several numerical investigations that indicate that neither a multicopy form nor a very-large-dimension catalyst is required to activate most allowed transformations catalytically.},

  title = {Multiobject operational tasks for convex quantum resource theories of state-measurement pairs},
  abstract = {The prevalent modus operandi within the framework of quantum resource theories has been to characterize and harness the resources within single objects, in what we can call single-object quantum resource theories. One can wonder, however, whether the resources contained within multiple different types of objects, now in a multiobject quantum resource theory, can simultaneously be exploited for the benefit of an operational task. In this work, we introduce examples of such multiobject operational tasks in the form of subchannel discrimination and subchannel exclusion games, in which the player harnesses the resources contained within the composite object of a state-measurement pair. We prove that for any state-measurement pair in which either of them is resourceful, there exist discrimination and exclusion games for which such a pair outperforms any possible free state-measurement pair. These results hold for arbitrary convex resources of states, and arbitrary convex resources of measurements where the set of free measurements is closed under classical post-processing. Furthermore, we prove that the advantage in these multiobject operational tasks is determined, in a multiplicative manner, by the resource quantifiers of: generalized robustness of resource of both state and measurement for discrimination games and weight of resource of both state and measurement for exclusion games.},

By exploring their compatibility with optical fiber components, we create four-dimensional quantum systems and implement the measurement-device-independent random number generation task with a programmable four-arm interferometer operating at a 2 MHz repetition rate. Due to the high visibilities observed, we surpass the one-bit limit of binary protocols and attain 1.23 bits of certified private randomness per experimental round. Our result demonstrates that fast switching, low loss, and high optical quality for high-dimensional quantum information can be simultaneously achieved with multi-core fiber technology.},

  abstract = {Measurement incompatibility is one of the basic aspects of quantum theory. Here we study the structure of the set of compatible, i.e., jointly measurable, measurements. We are interested in whether or not there exist compatible measurements whose parent is maximally complex, in the sense of requiring a number of outcomes exponential in the number of measurements, and related questions. Although we show this to be the case in a number of simple scenarios, we show that generically it cannot happen, by proving an upper bound on the number of outcomes of a parent measurement that is linear in the number of compatible measurements. We discuss why this does not trivialize the problem of finding parent measurements, but rather shows that a trade-off between memory and time can be achieved. Finally, we also investigate the complexity of extremal compatible measurements in regimes where our bound is not tight and uncover rich structure.},

It was recently shown, however, that all entangled states lead to nonclassical teleportation, with there being no classical scheme able to reproduce the states teleported to Bob. Here we study the operational significance of this result. On the one hand, we demonstrate that every state is useful for teleportation if a generalization of the average fidelity of teleportation is considered which concerns teleporting quantum correlations. On the other hand, we show the strength of a particular entangled state and entangled measurement for teleportation—as quantified by the robustness of teleportation—precisely characterizes their ability to offer an advantage in the task of subchannel discrimination with side information. This connection allows us to prove that every entangled state outperforms all separable states when acting as a quantum memory in this discrimination task. Finally, within the context of a resource theory of teleportation, we show that the two operational tasks considered provide complete sets of monotones for two partial orders based on the notion of teleportation simulation, one classical and one quantum.},

On the way, we also derive a general upper bound on the noise robustness for an arbitrary set of quantum measurements. Moreover, we prove the existence of sets of k MUB that are operationally inequivalent, as they feature different noise robustness, and we provide a lower bound on the number of such inequivalent sets up to dimension 32.

The standard benchmark for quantum teleportation, based on the average fidelity between the input and output states, indicates that some entangled states do not lead to channels which can be certified to be quantum. It was recently shown that if one considers a finer-grained witness, then all entangled states can be certified to produce a nonclassical teleportation channel. Here we experimentally demonstrate a complete characterization of a new family of such witnesses, of the type proposed in Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 110501 (2017) under different conditions of noise. We report nonclassical teleportation using quantum states that cannot achieve average fidelity of teleportation above the classical limit.

By developing a connection to entanglement witnesses, this formalism allows for new definitions of families of assemblages, in particular via (i) non-decomposable positive maps and (ii) unextendible product bases. The former proves to be useful for constructing post-quantum assemblages with the built-in feature of yielding only quantum correlations in Bell experiments, while the latter always gives certifiably post-quantum assemblages. Finally, our framework is equipped with an inherent quantifier of post-quantum steering, which we call the negativity of post-quantum steering. We postulate that post-quantum steering should not increase under one-way quantum operations from the steered parties to the steering parties, and we show that, in this sense, the negativity of post-quantum steering is a convex post-quantum-steering monotone.},

The proposed method allows us to derive optimal steering witnesses for arbitrary families of quantum states and provides a systematic framework to analytically derive nonlinear steering criteria. We discuss relevant examples and, in particular, provide an optimal steering witness for a lossy single-photon Bell state; the witness can be implemented just by linear optics and homodyne detection and detects steering with a higher loss tolerance than any other known method.

	abstract = {Quantum mechanics predicts the existence of intrinsically random processes. Contrary to classical randomness, this lack of predictability can not be attributed to ignorance or lack of control. Here we find the optimal method to quantify the amount of local or global randomness that can be extracted in two scenarios: (i) the quantum steering scenario, where two parties measure a bipartite system in an unknown state but one of them does not trust his measurement apparatus, and (ii) the prepare-and-measure scenario, where additionally the quantum state is known. We use our methods to compute the maximal amount of local and global randomness that can be certified by measuring systems subject to noise and losses and show that local randomness can be certified from a single measurement if and only if the detectors used in the test have detection efficiency higher than 50%.},

  abstract = {Work and quantum correlations are two fundamental resources in thermodynamics and quantum information theory. In this work, we study how to use correlations among quantum systems to optimally store work. We analyze this question for isolated quantum ensembles, where the work can be naturally divided into two contributions: a local contribution from each system and a global contribution originating from correlations among systems. We focus on the latter and consider quantum systems that are locally thermal, thus from which any extractable work can only come from correlations. We compute the maximum extractable work for general entangled states, separable states, and states with fixed entropy. Our results show that while entanglement gives an advantage for small quantum ensembles, this gain vanishes for a large number of systems.},

Here we present a missing design of a two-qubit fridge, the main feature of which is that one of the two machine qubits is itself maintained at a temperature colder than the cold bath. This is achieved by “reversing” the couplings to the baths compared to previous designs, where only a transition is maintained cold. We characterize the working regime and the efficiency of the fridge. We demonstrate the soundness of the model by deriving and solving a master equation. Finally, we discuss the performance of the fridge, in particular the heat current extracted from the cold bath. We show that our model performs comparably to the standard three-level quantum fridge and thus appears appealing for possible implementations of nanoscale thermal machines.},

To do so, we first give two model-independent definitions of the dimension of physical systems, based on measurements and the capacity of storing information. While both definitions are equivalent in classical and quantum mechanics, they are different in generalized probabilistic theories. We discuss in detail the case of a theory known as ‘boxworld’, and show that such a theory features systems with dimension mismatch. This dimension mismatch can be made arbitrarily large using an amplification procedure. Furthermore, we show that the dimension mismatch of boxworld has strong consequences on its power for performing information-theoretic tasks, leading to the collapse of communication complexity and to the violation of information causality. Finally, we discuss the consequences of a dimension mismatch from the perspective of thermodynamics, and ask whether this effect could break Landauerʼs erasure principle and thus the second law.},

Thermal machines act upon an external system by placing it in thermal contact with a well-selected range of virtual qubits and temperatures. We demonstrate these claims by studying the smallest thermal machines. We show further that this perspective provides a powerful way to view thermodynamics, by analyzing a number of phenomena. This includes approaching Carnot efficiency (where we find that all machines do so essentially by becoming equivalent to the smallest thermal machines), entropy production in irreversible machines, and a way to view work in terms of negative temperature and population inversion.

All optical demonstrations of such violations have involved discrete degrees of freedom and are plagued by the detection-efficiency loophole. A promising alternative is to use continuous variables combined with highly efficient homodyne measurements. However, all the schemes proposed so far use states or measurements that are extremely difficult to achieve, or they produce very weak violations. We present a simple method to generate large violations for feasible states using both photon counting and homodyne detections. The present scheme can also be used to obtain nonlocality from easy-to-prepare Gaussian states (e.g., two-mode squeezed state).},

From an operational point of view, a steering test can be seen as an entanglement test where one of the parties performs uncharacterised measurements. Thus, quantum steering is a form of quantum inseparability that lies in between the well-known notions of Bell nonlocality and entanglement. Moreover, quantum steering is also related to several asymmetric quantum information protocols where some of the parties are considered untrusted. Because of these facts, quantum steering has received a lot of attention both theoretically and experimentally. The main goal of this review is to give an overview of how to characterise quantum steering through semidefinite programming. This characterisation provides efficient numerical methods to address a number of problems, including steering detection, quantification, and applications. We also give a brief overview of some important results that are not directly related to semidefinite programming.
