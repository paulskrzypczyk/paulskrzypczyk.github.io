	abstract = {We introduce a resource theory of measurement informativeness. This allows us to define an associated quantifier, which we call the robustness of measurement. It describes how much “noise” must be added to a measurement before it becomes completely uninformative. We show that this geometric quantifier has operational significance in terms of the advantage the measurement provides over guessing at random in a suitably chosen state discrimination game and that it is the single-shot generalization of the accessible information of a certain quantum-to-classical channel. Using this insight, we further show that the recently introduced robustness of asymmetry or coherence is the single-shot generalization of the accessible information of an ensemble. Finally, we discuss more generally the connection between robustness-based measures, discrimination problems, and information-theoretic quantities.},

	abstract = {We develop a unified approach to classical, quantum and post-quantum steering. The framework is based on uncharacterised (black-box) parties performing quantum measurements on their share of a (possibly unphysical) quantum state, and its starting point is the characterisation of general no-signalling assemblages via non-positive local hidden-state models, which will be defined in this work. By developing a connection to entanglement witnesses, this formalism allows for new definitions of families of assemblages, in particular via (i) non-decomposable positive maps and (ii) unextendible product bases. The former proves to be useful for constructing post-quantum assemblages with the built-in feature of yielding only quantum correlations in Bell experiments, while the latter always gives certifiably post-quantum assemblages. Finally, our framework is equipped with an inherent quantifier of post-quantum steering, which we call the negativity of post-quantum steering. We postulate that post-quantum steering should not increase under one-way quantum operations from the steered parties to the steering parties, and we show that, in this sense, the negativity of post-quantum steering is a convex post-quantum-steering monotone.},

Unfortunately, traditional bipartite steering scenarios can always be explained by quantum theory.

The two scenarios we describe, which still feature Alice remotely steering Bob’s system, are (i) one where Bob also has an input and operates on his subsystem, and (ii) the “instrumental steering” scenario. We show that such bipartite postquantum steering is a genuinely new type of postquantum nonlocality, which does not follow from postquantum Bell nonlocality.

Most of this work has focused on the standard case where energy is the only conserved quantity. Here we consider a generalization of this work to deal with multiple conserved quantities. Each conserved quantity, which, importantly, need not commute with the rest, can be extracted and stored in its own battery. Unlike the standard case, in which the amount of extractable energy is constrained, here there is no limit on how much of any individual conserved quantity can be extracted. However, other conserved quantities must be supplied, and the second law constrains the combination of extractable quantities and the trade-offs between them. We present explicit protocols that allow us to perform arbitrarily good trade-offs and extract arbitrarily good combinations of conserved quantities from individual quantum systems.},

Virtual qubits are two-level subsystems of this composite, and their virtual temperatures can take on any value, positive or negative. Thermal machines act upon an external system by placing it in thermal contact with a well-selected range of virtual qubits and temperatures. We demonstrate these claims by studying the smallest thermal machines. We show further that this perspective provides a powerful way to view thermodynamics, by analyzing a number of phenomena. This includes approaching Carnot efficiency (where we find that all machines do so essentially by becoming equivalent to the smallest thermal machines), entropy production in irreversible machines, and a way to view work in terms of negative temperature and population inversion. Moreover we introduce the idea of “genuine” thermal machines and are led to considering the concept of “strength” of work.},

From an operational point of view, a steering test can be seen as an entanglement test where one of the parties performs uncharacterised measurements. Thus, quantum steering is a form of quantum inseparability that lies in between the well-known notions of Bell nonlocality and entanglement. Moreover, quantum steering is also related to several asymmetric quantum information protocols where some of the parties are considered untrusted. Because of these facts, quantum steering has received a lot of attention both theoretically and experimentally. The main goal of this review is to give an overview of how to characterise quantum steering through semidefinite programming. This characterisation provides efficient numerical methods to address a number of problems, including steering detection, quantification, and applications. We also give a brief overview of some important results that are not directly related to semidefinite programming.

The proposed method allows us to derive optimal steering witnesses for arbitrary families of quantum states and provides a systematic framework to analytically derive nonlinear steering criteria.

	abstract = {When separated measurements on entangled quantum systems are performed, the theory predicts correlations that cannot be explained by any classical mechanism: communication is excluded because the signal should travel faster than light; preestablished agreement is excluded because Bell inequalities are violated. All optical demonstrations of such violations have involved discrete degrees of freedom and are plagued by the detection-efficiency loophole. A promising alternative is to use continuous variables combined with highly efficient homodyne measurements. However, all the schemes proposed so far use states or measurements that are extremely difficult to achieve, or they produce very weak violations. We present a simple method to generate large violations for feasible states using both photon counting and homodyne detections. The present scheme can also be used to obtain nonlocality from easy-to-prepare Gaussian states (e.g., two-mode squeezed state).},

We use our methods to compute the maximal amount of local and global randomness that can be certified by measuring systems subject to noise and losses and show that local randomness can be certified from a single measurement if and only if the detectors used in the test have detection efficiency higher than 50\%.},

As applications, we provide a lower-bound estimate of the fraction of two-qubit local entangled states and present new explicit examples of such states, including those that arise from physical noise models, Bell-diagonal states, and noisy Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger and W states.},

Here, we report on the production of high-quality N×N (with N=4,7) multi-port beam splitters based on a new scheme for manipulating multi-core optical fibers. By exploring their compatibility with optical fiber components, we create four-dimensional quantum systems and implement the measurement-device-independent random number generation task with a programmable four-arm interferometer operating at a 2 MHz repetition rate. Due to the high visibilities observed, we surpass the one-bit limit of binary protocols and attain 1.23 bits of certified private randomness per experimental round. Our result demonstrates that fast switching, low loss, and high optical quality for high-dimensional quantum information can be simultaneously achieved with multi-core fiber technology.},

We further show that all pure partially entangled full-Schmidt-rank states in all dimensions can achieve maximal violation of these inequalities, and thus lead to maximal randomness generation in the one-sided device-independent setting.

Because of its generality, the attack applies to a large class of protocols, from standard prepare-and-measure to device-independent schemes. Our attack gives bounds on the critical detection efficiencies necessary for secure quantum key distribution, which show that the implementation of most partly device-independent solutions is, from the point of view of detection efficiency, almost as demanding as fully device-independent ones. We also show how our attack implies the existence of a form of bound randomness, namely nonlocal correlations in which a nonsignalling eavesdropper can find out a posteriori the result of any implemented measurement.},

	abstract = {Quantum catalysis is a fascinating concept that demonstrates how certain transformations can only become possible when given access to a specific resource that has to be returned unaffected. It was first discovered in the context of entanglement theory, and since then, it has been applied in a number of resource-theoretic frameworks, including quantum thermodynamics. Although, in that case, the necessary (and sometimes also sufficient) conditions on the existence of a catalyst are known, almost nothing is known about the precise form of the catalyst state required by the transformation. In particular, it is not clear whether it has to have some special properties or be finely tuned to the desired transformation. In this work, we describe a surprising property of multicopy states: We show that in resource theories governed by majorization, all resourceful states are catalysts for all allowed transformations. In quantum thermodynamics, this means that the so-called “second laws of thermodynamics” do not require a fine-tuned catalyst; rather, any state, given sufficiently many copies, can serve as a useful catalyst. These analytic results are accompanied by several numerical investigations that indicate that neither a multicopy form nor a very-large-dimension catalyst is required to activate most allowed transformations catalytically.},

Here we study the operational significance of this result. On the one hand, we demonstrate that every state is useful for teleportation if a generalization of the average fidelity of teleportation is considered which concerns teleporting quantum correlations. On the other hand, we show the strength of a particular entangled state and entangled measurement for teleportation—as quantified by the robustness of teleportation—precisely characterizes their ability to offer an advantage in the task of subchannel discrimination with side information. This connection allows us to prove that every entangled state outperforms all separable states when acting as a quantum memory in this discrimination task. Finally, within the context of a resource theory of teleportation, we show that the two operational tasks considered provide complete sets of monotones for two partial orders based on the notion of teleportation simulation, one classical and one quantum.},

It was recently shown that if one considers a finer-grained witness, then all entangled states can be certified to produce a nonclassical teleportation channel. Here we experimentally demonstrate a complete characterization of a new family of such witnesses, of the type proposed in Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 110501 (2017) under different conditions of noise. We report nonclassical teleportation using quantum states that cannot achieve average fidelity of teleportation above the classical limit.

It demonstrates that in certain situations the very presence of entanglement can improve one's abilities of manipulating other entangled states. At the same time, however, it is not clear if using entanglement catalytically can provide additional power for any of the existing quantum protocols. Here we show, for the first time, that catalysis of entanglement can provide a genuine advantage in the task of quantum teleportation. More specifically, we show that extending the standard teleportation protocol by giving Alice and Bob the ability to use entanglement catalytically, allows them to achieve fidelity of teleportation at least as large as the regularisation of the standard teleportation quantifier, the so-called average fidelity of teleportation. Consequently, we show that this regularised quantifier surpasses the standard benchmark for a variety of quantum states, therefore demonstrating that there are quantum states whose ability to teleport can be further improved when assisted with entanglement in a catalytic way. This hints that entanglement catalysis can be a promising new avenue for exploring novel advantages in the quantum domain.},
